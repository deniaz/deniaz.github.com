# Robert Vogt

I'm a Software Engineer living in Switzerland, creating smart web applications for complex cases at smartive. Most of my time away from keyboard is spent either on my CUBE Stereo 160 C:62 or my Santa Cruz Fusion TT â€” depending on the season.

My current stack of choice is based around the JavaScript ecosystem with technologies like TypeScript, React and Node.
